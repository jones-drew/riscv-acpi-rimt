== Introduction

The RISC-V IO Mapping Table (RIMT)  provides information about the RISC-V IOMMU and the relationship
between the IO topology and the IOMMU in ACPI based RISC-V platforms. The RIMT identifies which
components are behind IOMMU and how they are connected together. RISC-V IOMMU can be implemented as
either a PCI device or a platform device.
